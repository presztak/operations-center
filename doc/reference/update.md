# Update

Operations Center acts as the update hub for IncusOS servers. IncusOS servers
contact Operations Center to look for newer software and download updates if
available. This allows deployments to easily operate in an air gaped environment
by only having one place to push new update files to.

Operations Center handles the central IncusOS update management. In this role,
Operations Center keeps the relevant updates available locally.

Operations Center has a single source configured in the config file. If
Operations Center does have internet access, it checks the registered update
source on a recurring schedule (by default hourly) for new updates and downloads
them to the local cache.

It is also possible to operate Operations Center in air gapped environments,
where the updates are provided manually by the administrators.

## Trigger an update

An update can be triggered either for the operating system or for individual
applications:

```shell
operations-center provisioning server system update <server> --os
operations-center provisioning server system update <server> --application incus
```

Triggering an update of the operating system makes IncusOS update every
installed application as well. `--os` therefore covers the whole server and can
not be combined with `--application`.

An update of the operating system is staged and applied with the next reboot of
the server, while an application is updated right away, which restarts that
application.

Since the update is performed by the server itself, a successful invocation only
means the update has been triggered. Operations Center reports the server as
`updating` until the server no longer reports any component in need of an
update.

## Filtering

The updates, which should be downloaded and be made available for the managed
IncusOS instances, can be filtered based on various criteria.

See [filtering](filters) for more information on the syntax of the filtering
expression.

### Update level filters

Update level filters are configured using the `filter_expression` config key
in the [Update settings](settings.md#update-settings).

They allow filtering of updates based on their metadata.

| Property            | Description                                  | Example                                     |
| :---                | :---                                         | :---                                        |
| `upstream_channels` | Upstream channels, the update is part of     | `stable`, `testing`, `daily`                |
| `origin`            | Source the update originates from            | `linuxcontainers.org`                       |
| `published_at`      | Timestamp when the update has been published | `2025-11-21T22:30:02.515408725Z`            |
| `severity`          | Severity of the update                       | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |
| `uuid`              | Unique identifier of the update              | `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`      |
| `version`           | Version of the update                        | `202511201340`                              |

The following properties are available during filtering as well, but they are
not really useful as filter criteria and are only listed here for completeness.

* `uuid`: Unique identifier of the update
* `format`: Version of the update index file format, currently `1.0`
* `channels`: Channels the update is part of, during retrieval of the update this is always the default channel
* `changelog`: Content of the changelog
* `update_status`: state from Operations Center point of view, if the update is `ready` or `pending`; when the filtering is applied, the updates are never `ready`
* `url`: Source URL of the update

### File level filters

File level filters are configured using the `file_filter_expression` config key
in the [Update settings](settings.md#update-settings).

They allow filtering of update files based on their metadata.

| Property       | Description                             | Example                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Prepare manual updates

Manual updates can be provided to Operations Center as tar files. Each tar file
is expected to contain a single update, and the content of the tar file is
expected to match the file system tree of
`https://images.linuxcontainers.org/os/VERSION/`, so at its root it needs the
`update.sjson` file and then have the folder structure with the architectures
and the files inside those.

It's possible to skip files that are not needed, for example, architectures
not used, can be left out of the tar file.
